KTextEditor::

line/column -> KTextEditor::Cursor
cursor -> KTextEditor::Range


Add New:
KTextEditro::Factory

Removed:
- all DCOP interfaces
- ClipboardInterface
- CursorInterface
- DynWordWrapInterface
- PrintInterface
- SelectionExtDCOPInterface
- UndoInterface
- ViewStatusMsgInterface
- WordWrapInterface

Merged:
- BlockSelectionInterface, SelectionInterface and SelectionInterfaceExt were
  merged into the KTextEditor::View, so that a KTextEditor::Document itself
  does not provide any selection methods anymore.
- ConfigInterface was partly merged into the KTextEditor::Editor and now only
  contains very basic functions to set/get properties. Session related config
  options can be configured in a new interface called 
  KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface
- DocumentInfoInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::Document
- EditInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::Document
- EditInterfaceExt was merged into the KTextEditor::Document
- EncodingInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::Document
- HighlightingInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::Document
- MarkInterfaceExtension was merged into the KTextEditor::MarkInterface
- PluginViewInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::Plugin
- PopupMenuInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::View
- ViewCursorInterface was merged into the KTextEditor::View

Changed:
- KTextEditor::CodeCompletionInterface was changed to support several clients
  at once. A client registers a so-called KTextEditor::CompletionProvider that
  provides its own completion and argument hint da.
- CompletionEntry was renamed to KTextEditor::CompletionItem
- signal modifiedOnDisc() was renamed to 
  KTextEditor::ModificationInterface::modifiedOnDisk()
